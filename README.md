MP3 Player project for LPC2148

See my original [blog post](http://t413.com/2010/11/mp3-player-design/) about this project.

### Background
Built to run on a Phillips NXP LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller. I used the LPC2148 Development Board from sjvalley.com.

This project uses [read_ID3_info](httpshttps://github.com/t413/read_ID3_info) MP3 tag reader.
